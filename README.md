## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that helps in understanding public opinions and sentiments. This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and text classification techniques to automatically classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which includes 50,000 highly polar movie reviews, each labeled as either "positive" or "negative." The dataset is structured as follows:

- **Review Data**: The text of the movie review.
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment associated with the review (positive or negative).

The dataset is loaded directly from a CSV file during the execution of the code.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK (for natural language processing)
- Google Colab (for file uploading in Google Colab)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
